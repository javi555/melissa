Melissa
======

Melissa offers optimization in the passage of messages between several limited resource nodes and a high-performance node for intensive processing (for example contour detection).

To do this, you will use the ZeroMQ libraries together with Klepsydra, and the results can be seen with the OpenMCT display framework.
